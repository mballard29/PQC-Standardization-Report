\section{Conclusion}
Information makes up the threads that tie us together in this world and supports us as we move forward; therefore, the threat of a quantum computer capable of breaking the system that protect this information was a cause of great concern. Its unclear when such a computer will exist, and the power that a quantum computer may provide is only just started to be uncovered. With great potential and also posing great risk, we have seen individuals as well as government come together to find solutions that cross countries and backgrounds. This initial standardization phases is not over. We do not yet have a quantum computer to effectively test if they are fully secure and if they are, how long they will be so. Its too early in this ``quantum revolution" to be able to tell how rapidly the field will grow. There is a whole world cryptography that could developed with quantum computers yet untapped. Beyond the codification and standards, it is yet to be delved into the possible applications for quantum computers though theoretical ideas do exist. Uncertainty can invite fear, but there is also a very high ceiling for potential which we are only just beginning to explore. Healthy curiosity and teamwork has brought us here, and maybe these pieces are exactly what we need to keep moving forward.
