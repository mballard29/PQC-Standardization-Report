written by Mason Ballard


### My roles, responsibilities, and accomplishments:
* Led research reporting on the National Institute for Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Post-Quantum Standardization “competition”. 
* Acting as an all-source analyst, compiled resources from a variety of mostly primary reputable sources in a series of different mediums about the nature of as well as the background of quantum computing, its potential effects on the cryptographic community, its potential effect on the whole information security world, and the past and current initiatives as well as the latest updates by NIST and the research community in designing, implementing, and evaluating algorithms for standardization. This culminated in a 50-page research paper including a glossary, an appendix, a works cited, and some custom graphics, written and compiled in LaTeX. 
* Received an A on the paper.
